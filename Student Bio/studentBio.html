        <p>My name is Grant Kourey and I am currently enrolled in UC Berkeley's Coding Boot Camp. I was previously in 
            software sales at companies like Oracle, NetSuite, and BigCommerce. I have chosen to move into development 
            because it is something I enjoy and I have always had an interest in building software as opposed to selling
            it. After graduation, I hope to get a job as a developer and then moving into product management.
        </p>
