                <p>My name is Grant Kourey and I am currently enrolled in UC Berkeley's Coding Boot Camp. I was previously in 
                software sales at companies like Oracle, NetSuite, and BigCommerce. I have chosen to move into development 
                because it is something I enjoy and I have always had an interest in building software as opposed to selling
                it. After receiving my certificate, I hope to get a job as a developer and then move into product management.
